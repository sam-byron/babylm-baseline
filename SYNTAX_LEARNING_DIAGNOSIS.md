# BLiMP Performance Diagnosis: Critical Syntax Learning Issues

## Executive Summary
Your custom LTG-BERT model is underperforming on BLiMP (59.6% vs 72.2% on supplement tasks) due to **fundamental issues in data preprocessing that destroy syntactic structure**. The current pipeline concatenates entire documents without proper sentence boundaries, robbing the model of crucial syntactic learning opportunities.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **SENTENCE BOUNDARY DESTRUCTION** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: The current data pipeline processes entire documents as single sequences, destroying natural sentence boundaries.

**Evidence**:
- Tokenized sequences are 3K-25K tokens long (entire documents)
- Raw data shows proper sentence structure: `'Well now James, what can we do for you?'`
- Tokenized data concatenates everything: `"# ` a'- level history lecture call ##ey :'yeah erm the other er aspect..."`

**Impact on Syntax Learning**:
- Model cannot learn sentence-level syntactic patterns
- Attention spans across unrelated sentences
- No clear syntactic boundaries for learning phrase structure
- MLM objectives become document-level rather than sentence-level

### 2. **DOCUMENT-LEVEL CONCATENATION WITHOUT SENTENCE DELIMITERS**
**Current Pipeline Flow**:
```
convert_bnc.py → Raw markdown files (proper sentence structure)
                ↓
prepare_data.py → Loads entire .md files as single strings
                ↓
utils_mp.py → Tokenizes entire documents as single sequences
                ↓
MLM training → Model sees 3K-25K token sequences without sentence boundaries
```

**What the model sees**:
```
# Medical consultation [UNK]: 'Well now James, what can we do for you?' Bessie: 'Oh [UNK]' Cassi: 'Not so bad. Not so bad.' Bessie: '[UNK] I feel a bit sad. I'm my daughter's taken me hol me away for a holiday. Erm' Cassi: 'Mhm.' ...
```

**What it should see**:
```
[CLS] Well now James, what can we do for you? [SEP]
[CLS] Oh [UNK] [SEP]  
[CLS] Not so bad. [SEP]
[CLS] I feel a bit sad. [SEP]
```

### 3. **SPECIFIC SYNTAX LEARNING FAILURES**

#### Argument Structure Issues
- **Problem**: Without sentence boundaries, the model cannot learn verb subcategorization frames
- **BLiMP Evidence**: Transitive (72%) vs Intransitive (49%) performance gap
- **Cause**: Model sees `'verb object verb object verb'` across sentence boundaries instead of learning `'intransitive-verb [SENTENCE_END]'` vs `'transitive-verb object [SENTENCE_END]'`

#### NPI Licensing Failures  
- **Problem**: NPI (Negative Polarity Item) licensing requires sentence-level scope
- **BLiMP Evidence**: NPI tasks performing at 21-34% (near chance)
- **Cause**: Model cannot learn sentence-level licensing conditions when sentences are concatenated

#### Agreement Phenomena Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Some agreement works (irregular: 97.6%) but basic agreement fails (35.3%)
- **Cause**: Local agreement patterns survive concatenation, but sentence-level agreement fails

### 4. **MLM DATASET ARCHITECTURE ISSUES**

The `mlm_dataset.py` shows that your training uses:
- `DocumentDataset` or `OrderDataset` which segments documents
- But these operate on already-destroyed sentence boundaries from the tokenization phase
- The damage is done before MLM training even begins

## Root Cause Analysis

### `convert_bnc.py` Analysis
Your BNC conversion correctly processes XML structure and maintains sentence boundaries in the markdown output:
```python
def get_sentence(sentence):
    words = word_iterator(sentence)
    text = ''.join(words)
    return text
```

**BUT** the issue is in downstream processing!

### `prepare_data.py` - The Culprit
```python
def load_md_files_to_dataset(data_dir):
    """Load all .md files as complete file contents, not line by line"""
    # ...
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read().strip()  # ← READS ENTIRE FILE AS ONE STRING
        if content:
            texts.append(content)    # ← DESTROYS SENTENCE BOUNDARIES
```

### `utils_mp.py` - Compounds the Problem
```python
def process_and_save_chunk(arg, tokenizer_unused=None):
    sample_chunk = [sample["text"] for sample in sample_chunk]  # Each "text" is an entire document
    tokenized_batch = tokenizer.encode_batch(sample_chunk)      # Tokenizes documents, not sentences
```

## Comparison with Standard BERT Training

**Standard BERT Training**:
- Processes individual sentences
- Uses sentence pairs for NSP (Next Sentence Prediction)
- Maintains clear syntactic boundaries
- MLM operates within sentence context

**Your Current Training**:
- Processes entire documents as single sequences
- No sentence-level structure
- MLM operates across document context
- Syntactic patterns are diluted across discourse

## Immediate Action Required

### 1. **Fix Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
**Goal**: Preserve sentence boundaries during tokenization

**Required Changes**:
```python
# In prepare_data.py - Change from document-level to sentence-level processing
def load_md_files_to_sentences(data_dir):
    """Load .md files and split into individual sentences"""
    sentences = []
    for file_path in md_files:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            # Split by speaker turns and sentences
            for line in content.split('\n'):
                if line.strip() and not line.startswith('#'):
                    # Extract sentence from speaker format: "Speaker: 'sentence'"
                    if ':' in line and "'" in line:
                        sentence = extract_sentence_from_speaker_line(line)
                        if sentence and len(sentence.split()) > 3:  # Filter very short
                            sentences.append(sentence)
    return Dataset.from_dict({"text": sentences})
```

### 2. **Modify MLM Training**
- Use sentence-level sequences (64-128 tokens)
- Implement proper NSP with sentence pairs
- Ensure [CLS] and [SEP] tokens mark sentence boundaries

### 3. **Retrain with Sentence-Aware Data**
The current model cannot be fixed without retraining because the fundamental training data structure is wrong.

## Expected Improvements

**After fixing sentence boundaries**:
- **Argument Structure**: Should improve from 49%/72% gap to balanced performance
- **NPI Licensing**: Should improve from 21-34% to 60-80%
- **Agreement**: Should become more consistent across all agreement types
- **Overall BLiMP Filtered**: Should improve from 59.6% to 65-70%

## Why BLiMP Supplement Still Works

BLiMP Supplement (72.2%) tests broader semantic/pragmatic phenomena that:
- Don't require precise sentence-level syntactic boundaries
- Can be learned from discourse-level patterns
- Are more robust to concatenated text

This explains the performance gap: your model learned discourse patterns but missed sentence-level syntax.

## Conclusion

The 12.6 percentage point gap between BLiMP Supplement and Filtered is **not a model architecture issue** but a **fundamental data preprocessing problem**. The model never had the opportunity to learn proper syntax because sentence boundaries were destroyed before training began.
